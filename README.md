# ShortCommands

A pocketmine plugin that implements a number of default commands in a shorthand form/default commands that do not perform action through console.

# How to install
1. Download the recent phar from poggit.
2. Go to your plugins folder and upload the plugin.
3. Restart your server.

# Commands
- /gm (0,1,2,3) or (survival, creative, adventure, spectator)
Survival = 0 
Creative = 1
Adventure = 2
Spectator = 3

To set the gamemode of somebody else run /gm (number/gamemode) (player name).
This command can also be ran via console :D.

- /giveitem (player) (itemid) (count)
Now I know what you are thinking, /give is shorter, however, when players attempt to give items through crates/relics etc with /give, it shows in chat to all players because of a certain message set in pocketmine which sometimes is inconvenient, if you use /giveitem in crates etc or just generally, it will not show up in chat which in my opinion is good.

You can also run this command via console :D.

# Notes
- /gamemode and /give will still be usable.
- Currently, messages are not configurable however that is a planned feature.
